# pace_calculator
A excel spreadsheet to calculate estimated times between aid stations, total times, times until cut off, that is adjustable by actual times

#HOW TO USE

Enter aid station names/numbers into column A, distance between aid stations in column B, and cut off times in column Q. 

Pace (in hours/distance) and distance can be adjusted as desired (green boxes)

Do not change values in blue boxes!

The units the distance are in doesn't matter

If there aren't enough rows, just copy and paste the last rows- copy the entire rows so you also capture the hidden columns

Splits are only accurate if check-in times have been entered for the beginning and the end of the split- otherwise they are entirely or partially influenced by the projected pace.

It is okay to leave cells blank in columns L or Q

###This is the most user unfriendly part!
If #VALUE! appears in columns K, N and/or P it could be because of columns L or Q formatting:

Column Q must be formatted as text by left clicking -> format cells... -> numbers -> text and then entering the data in the format "hr:min:sec am/pm" (i.e. 7:21:22 pm) (there must be a space between the time and am/pm- min/sec are optional). If you copy it in and it doesn't work right, you may have to format the cells as text and then type or change the entries. Just keep messing around until you get it- sorry it's so frustrating.
